u dont have to show me this, I will google it - its taking too much of ur time - I will figure out the readme and markdown 
thank you very much for being patient and showing me 

After I am done with the  readme, do u have any other tips for my github?
Well, I have some tips for the readme itself
You can write a small, descriptive introduciton 
You can also write a guidd of how files are organised.
Also, It's preferable to describe how othere can reproduce the results, pointing them out to what fields they should fill to use their own data
or guiding them to run which sripts to do what
In essence, a readme is "showcasing" and "a guide for reproduceability"--- awesome I think I get the idea

great
do u treat repos like folders to showcase different projects? 
yes, if I have separate projects, I create a repo for each. Some colleagues of mine did something else
for example, in  acourse, there are like weekly labs and assignments, wehn the semester is finished, the y upload it all to one repo.
So, I would say it depends. If the projects are small, and related, we can upload them all to a single repo
if not, then a separate repo will do.

Got it, do Github support image and doc file uploads (resumes and powerbi examples) or even pbix files? 
any file can be uploaded to the remote repo. Do you mean them being dsiplayed in the readme?
I guess u can attach them as a link to readme right? 
yes, images work like that. you attach link and it renders. For example. Well I used an HTML tag here xD. 
I think that was all the questions I had -
my only request is not to use the pythonnotebook for now
I will change all the fields in it and give it to u in 2 weeks. 

This is super helpful and thank you- shall we move back to our project? 
I think we should plan to wrap it up today so I can send ur money 
ok, so taht's it for github? - I think so - whatever tip u gave me is enough to get me started - anything honestly would be a big level up to what I have

my only other thing is if u can just show me branching and forking - got 10 minutes? I will download github desktop otherwise we can move to python

ok , we can do that. I would encourage using git though. Github desktop uis ok, but it's just a personal preference. I am not comfortable with git- have tried it in the past - Ok, np

can u copy paste the link here? the repo? the markup best practices or something like that-
the one I cut u off ok one sec
